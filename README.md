# Egghead - Using the Gatsby Plugin Starter

Use official Gatsby starters to create an example site and a plugin that can be developed alongside it. This is a quick way to get started building your own plugin.

## üßê What's Inside

- `/my-plugin`: the example plugin that can implement Gatsby APIs
- `/my-gatsby-project`: the example site that includes the sample plugin

To see the plugin run, navigate into the example site in the `my-gatsby-project` directory and run `gatsby develop` (after cloning and installing dependencies).
